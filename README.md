Introduction 

What is Apache Airflow?
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed for orchestrating complex workflows and data pipelines. It enables you to programmatically define, schedule, and monitor workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Airflow simplifies the management of data pipelines, making it a powerful tool for data engineering and automation tasks.

Key Features
DAGs as Code: Define workflows using Python code, making them version-controlled and reproducible.

Task Dependencies: Specify dependencies between tasks, ensuring they execute in the correct order.

Scheduling: Schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals.

Extensibility: Easily integrate with various data sources, destinations, and external systems.

Monitoring: View real-time task status, logs, and execution history through a web-based user interface.

Extensive Community: Benefit from a large and active community of users and contributors.

Use Cases
Apache Airflow can be used for a wide range of use cases, including:

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
Data warehousing
Data migration
Workflow automation
Reporting and data analysis
Machine learning model training and deployment
